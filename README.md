# rusty_cryptography_kit

This is a simple cryptography kit written in Rust and is a collection of cryptographic algorithms and tools that I have
implemented for fun. This is not meant to be used in production and is purely for educational purposes. The following
algorithms are implemented:

1. Caesar Cipher
2. Vigenere Cipher
3. AtBash Cipher
4. One Time Pad Encryption
5. ROT13

The package also contains a basic Trie implementation that can be used for dictionary attacks and a command line tool
that can save and load Trie data structures to disk.
